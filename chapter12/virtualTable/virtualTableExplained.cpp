// 
// Class members location upon multiple inheritance:
// -------------------------------------------------
// 1) When a derived class inherites from two (or more) "base" classes, the layout of all her members (hers + the inherited ones) are according to the order of the 
//    inheritence:
//    # Base1's members
//    # Base2's members
//    # Derived's members
// 2) The address of the "this" pointer of the Derived class is the same as the address of the first member of her -- which is the first member of the "first"
//    base class.
//    NOTE: The term "first base class" referes to the actuall first base class name in the dervied class definition. For example, as in the case below where the dervied class is 
//    defined as follows:class Derived : public Base1 , public Base2 --> Base1 is the "first base class" and Base2 is the second.
// 
// virtual table under the hood:
// -----------------------------
// Some notes about virtual functions and virtual tables:
// 0) Once a class has AT LEAST one virtual function --> it implies that it will have a virtual table + virtual pointer.
// 1) A virtual table is created ONCE for each class. It is located (implementation specific) somewhere (probably) in the BSS segment (all the data
//    which is relevant for constructing the virtual table is known at compile time so it could be placed there).It is static. 
// 2) The objective of the virtual pointer is to point to the virtual table.Its location will be (usually) at the first 4/8 bytes of the object (32/64 bit).
// 3) Virtual table is basically a structure that holds all the function pointers to all the VIRTUAL functions of an object. Note: It DOES NOT hold the 
//    pointers to non-virtual functions.
// 4) In the case of multiple inheritence, the derived class will inherite all it's base class(es) virtual pointer, thus increasing its size respectevly. 
//    Note that there will be no need for an additional virtual pointer "specifically" for the derived object (so in the example below - only two virtual pointers
//    will be added to the derived class). 
//    The layout will be as follows: (for the case below fo class Derived : public Base1, public Base2):
//    NOTES: 
//    - We assume "theoretically" there is no padding.
//    - Size of int and pointer is 4 bytes.
// 
//    bytes |           data
//    ---------------------------------  
//    0-3   |  vptr for Base1 v-table.
//    4-7   |  Base1 member (int)
//    8-11  |  vptr for Base2 v-table.
//    12-15 |  Base2 member (int)
//    16-19 |  Derived member (int)
//
//  5) The "extra" code that does the initialization of the v-table for each class in inserted by the compiler (for each ctor) right after the class's base class 
//     is done (in case there is one) and just before the body of the ctor is executed.
//     --> Due to this fact, calling a virtual function within a ctor, will invoke the current "most derived version" and NOT the absoulute most derived version 
//     ( as we wish...). 
//  
//  6) Some impacts of using v-table:
//     a) Calling a virtual function costs us in an extra read of the address of the actual function to be invoked during run-time (not so bad).
//        The exact arithmetic being done is pointer read + offset manipulation. 
//     b) Virtual functions CAN NOT be inline !!
//
