The batch script located in this folder create a Visual Studio solution for each item we wish to, for instance:
$ buildItemSolutionForVisualStudio item3 
--> Will generate (all) the neccessary files to represent this item as a VS solution (within a dedicated build folder within the item folder, i.e.- item3/build).
